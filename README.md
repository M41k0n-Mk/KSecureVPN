# KSecureVPN

KSecureVPN is an open-source VPN solution developed in Kotlin, designed for learning, experimentation, and personal portfolio. The project aims to provide a straightforward, modular, and secure virtual private network implementation that demonstrates core networking, cryptography, and authentication principles.

## Goals

- **Educational:** Serve as a learning platform for developers interested in understanding the inner workings of VPNs, network protocols, and security practices. All code is written with clarity and extensive documentation.
- **Personal Use:** Offer a lightweight VPN solution for private use, allowing secure communication between devices over potentially unsafe networks.
- **Portfolio:** Showcase advanced backend and Kotlin development skills, including network programming, concurrency with coroutines, and practical application of cryptography.

## Features (MVP)

- **Basic Tunneling:** Establishes secure client-server communication using TCP sockets, encapsulating IP packets.
- **Encryption:** Implements AES-based encryption to protect data in transit.
- **Simple Authentication:** Supports username/password authentication to restrict access.
- **Session Tracking:** Each connection is assigned a unique session ID for debugging and audit purposes.
- **Secure Logging:** Detailed debug logs with decryption error tracking, protected from unauthorized access. Console output remains generic and safe.
- **Modular Design:** Organized in clear modules: networking, cryptography, authentication, configuration.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on any JVM-supported system (Linux, Windows, macOS).

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture for clarity and extensibility:

- **Core Layer:** Contains the main VPN logic, session management, and packet handling.
- **Networking Layer:** Manages socket connections, packet encapsulation, and transmission.
- **Security Layer:** Handles encryption/decryption and authentication schemes.
- **Interface Layer:** Provides CLI tools for configuration and usage.

## Why Kotlin?

Kotlin offers a modern, concise syntax, powerful concurrency primitives (coroutines), and excellent interoperability with Java libraries and platforms. It enables rapid development of robust, cross-platform backend applications, and is a perfect choice for demonstrating advanced software engineering concepts.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1:** Implement basic client-server tunneling over TCP.
2. **Phase 2:** Add AES encryption for all transmitted data.
3. **Phase 3:** Integrate simple authentication mechanism.
4. **Phase 4:** Provide CLI commands for user interaction.
5. **Phase 5:** Expand documentation, testing, and add optional features (multi-client support, UDP support, improved configuration).

## Limitations

KSecureVPN is intended primarily for educational and personal use. It is not a replacement for production-grade VPNs, and does not guarantee protection against sophisticated attacks or fulfill enterprise security standards.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Build with Maven: `mvn clean install`
- Configure logging (optional): See [docs/LOGGING.md](src/main/kotlin/docs/LOGGING.md)
- Run the server and client from CLI
- Follow documentation for configuration and usage examples
